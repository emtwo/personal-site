				<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
				<h3>PHP</h3>
				<h4>Background: </h4>
				<p>
				I introduced myself to PHP a little over a year ago when I decided to have my own online portfolio.  PHP seemed like a widely used web langauge
				and there were a lot of cool PHP projects that intrigued me. I only used PHP a little bit here and there up until my creation of the <a href="http://www.marinasamuel.com/blog_engine">SamBlogger</a> blogging engine.
				A direct link & some details about SamBlogger are below.
				</p>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.marinasamuel.com/blog_engine">www.marinasamuel.com/blog_engine</a></p>
				
				<p>
					<h4>Features:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Easy to use, crisp and simple GUI design</li>
						<li>Allows for creating, deleting, editing blog posts and deleting comments by others</li>
						<li>Authentication encrypting password</li>
						<li>Easily integrable into html for adding to your own website</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>In the Future:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Will be available for the public to use!</li>
						<li>Will be using it myself on this website!</li>
						<li>API for users to create/edit blogs etc. so using the GUI is not necessary</li>
						<li>Give users more room for customizing their blog</li>
						<li>Bug fixes</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Things to Note:</h4>
					<ul>

				<h3>Actionscript 3</h3>
				<h4>Background:</h4>
				<p>
				I began my interest in Actionscript 3 when I had my first co-op term at IBM in Summer 2009.  I've done a lot of work with Actionscript 3 at IBM
				since then and I still continue to use it frequently.  <!--The banner is a little experiment I tried when I first started learning
				Actionscript 3.  It looks relatively simple, but much of the programming went into the flexiblity it allows for content updates through XML.-->
				Disney's Ditzy Destructor is a recent project I've started which still has a long way to go
				but you can get an idea of where I'd like to go with it in the near future by looking at what I've got so far. <!--Links to both items are listed
				below along with some comments.-->
				A link to it is shown below with some comments
				</p>
				
				<p><a href="Game.swf">Disney's Ditzy Destructor V. 0.5</a></p>
				<p>
					<h4>Future Updates Will Include:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Improved Collision Detection</li>
						<li>Brief Tutorial & Guiding Screens</li>
						<li>Background Music & Audio Controls</li>
						<li>Speaking Minnie</li>
						<li>Enemy Artificial Intelligence (they try to attack you etc.)</li>
						<li>Many More Levels With More Elements to Interact With</li>
						<li>Overall Improved Presentation</li>
						<li>List of High Scores</li>
						<li>Improved Memory Management (to ensure the game runs faster/smoother)</li>
						<li>Bug Fixes</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<!--
				<p><a href="">Banner</a></p>
				<p>
					<h4>Ask Me About:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>How this banner is related to my work at IBM</li>
						<li>How this banner can be extended to function as an Intelligent Navigator</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Visual Basic</h3>
				<h4>Background: </h4>
				<p>
				I have not worked with Visual Basic in a couple of years but the Schedule Planner I created in grade 12 was quite the feat considering it was my first 
				ever personal programming project. Looking back at it now after gaining a lot of GUI Development experience, I think there is a lot of room for improvement
				for this project but nonetheless it still continues to serve its required purpose. The link directs you to a downloadable .exe file containing the Schedule Planner.

				<div id="scheduler">
					<img id="scheduler" src="scheduler.jpg" width="568px" height="713px" alt="Scheduler Image" />
				</div>
				
				<h4>Planner Design:</h4>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Automated scheduling suggestions based on a time optimization algorithm</li>
						<li>Designed specifically for students attending self-paced, independent study schools with a system much like universities</li>
						<li>
						Considered the following factors in its optimization algorithm:
							<ul>
								<li>Teacher Availability</li>
								<li>Examination Scheduling</li>
								<li>Seminar/Lecture Scheduling</li>
								<li>How Ahead/Behind a Student is in a Course</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>C/C++</h3>
				<h4>Background: </h4>
				<p>
					I was first introduced to C/C++ in Fall 2008, approximately two years ago, in my first year as a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.  
					As I progress into higher years in university, I realize that CS 137 and CS 138 in first year were really amazing introductory programming courses. 
					Almost any new programming concepts I learn to this day build on key foundations from these courses. The Polynomial library is one of my first fun little creations
					in C. Links to the source code can be found below.
				</p>
				
				<p><a href="poly.c">Polynomial Library</a></p>
				<p><a href="poly.h">Polynomial Header File</a></p>
				
				<h4>Polynomial Library Functionality: </h4>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Multiplication(or Division), Addition(or Subtraction)</li>
						<li>Derivative Computation</li>
						<li>Evaluating a Polynomial given an x value</li>
						<li>Degree of Polynomial</li>
						<li>Printing</li>
					</ul>
