				<h2>Welcome to Marina Samuel's Online Portfolio!</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Marina and I am currently a <a href="http://www.softeng.uwaterloo.ca/">Software Engineering</a> student at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have designed this website to showcase some of my personal software projects as well as give you insight on my thoughts, interests, and speculations.
					For me it is an exciting and thought-provoking journey amalgamating some of the most meaningful components in my life into one simple website.
					For you, it is my hope that it will provide enlightenment on who I am and what it is like inside the mind of a unique Software Engineering student.
