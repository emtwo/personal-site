				<p>
					I was born in Cairo, Egypt and grew up in the busy city of Toronto, Canada.  I am currently a <a href="http://www.softeng.uwaterloo.ca/">Software 
Engineering</a> student in third year
					at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> in Waterloo, Canada.    
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I began my interest in Computer Science back in 2005 when I took my first BASIC programming course and immediately loved it.
					It was such a new and intriguing form of expression in my mind and I was thriving to learn more.  Since then I've taken many more courses
					and learned many more languages, concepts, and theories related to programming.  It seems that the more I learn, the more exciting 
					it gets, opening my mind to the delightful possibilities that await us in the future. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is my inspiration to some day make a significant impact in our ever-evolving world of technology that will be remembered for years to come.
